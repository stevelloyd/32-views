In about 1830, Hokusai and his daughter Ōi created a series of prints called " (a ((href "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji")) "36 views of Mount Fuji") ". They were published in groups over a number of months, and made use of new materials; available to Japanese artists economically for the first time (for example, the pigment " (em "Berlin Blue") ").

For the price of a PS4 game, anyone can buy a Raspberry Pi computer, take over the family TV as a monitor and explore the fantastic fun of computing. Also the Pi is powerful enough to support seriously capable programming tools–Python is rightly of course incredibly popular, but is only one of many systems which can be used in this activity; available for the price of a couple of minutes of your time installing them.")

If programming languages are the computing equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife (™ Victorinox AG), Racket is like having a Swiss Army Knife factory. Experiencing it is well worth your time and effort, even (especially) if you plan to use other languages mostly.")
